.SH NAME
hippiswd \- HIPPI switch manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
hippiswd [-c <config file>] [-d] [-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hippisd connects to all switches described in the HIPPI configuration
file and logs all output from the switches to a log file. In addition,
it listens on a TCP socket.  Client programs can connect and send
commands to the any of the HIPPI switches.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.nf
.RS
.DT
.ft B
-c <configfile> Specify configuration file to use.

-d              Debug mode; don't actually connect to
                any switches.

-f              Force start. Currently this causes hippiswd to ignore
                any current hippiswd.pid file which might indicate the
                concurrent running of another daemon.

-v              Print version information and exit.
