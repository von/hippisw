		CHANGES

From 0.2 Beta to 0.2.1 Beta:
	BUG FIX: Disabling of ports was broken.
	BUG FIX: Fixed bug with mksw that caused it to not find the path
		to the tester on the switch which the tester was
		located.

From 0.1 Beta to 0.2 Beta:

	BUG FIX: hippiswd was calling abort() on segment violation
		instead of graceful_death().
	BUG FIX: When a connection was preempted message was not being
		printed to preempted user explaining preemption.
	CLEAN UP: hippisw usage output format cleaned up.
	ADDED: -f option to hippiswd to force it to ignore any current
		hippisw.pid file.
	ADDED: Daemon now checks to see if the host it's running on is
		the one specified in the configuration file and prints
		a warning to the log if it's not.
	ADDED: hippisw client will now automatically rerequest password
		if it is rejected by the daemon.
	ADDED: logging facilities. hippiswd will now pipe unexpect switch
		output through a specified log command. Other events are
		logged through syslog().
	BUG FIX: Exceptional conditions on a switch are now noted
		immediately and not the first time a user attempted to
		talk to it.
	BUG FIX: harp -c and -C arguments were broken.
	ADDED: Support for Cray Server 6400 to harp.
	BUG FIX: mksw would segment fault if tester was not present.
	BUG FIX: mksw -t option was broken.
	CHANGE: harp now uses -t option instead of -C for terse mode
		in order to standardize with mksw.
	BUG FIX: harp and other utilities would print NULL for a
		temporary hippi-xx address.
	BUG FIX: fixed bug with mksw outputing port numbers for ES1
		switches incorrectly.
	ADDED: ES1 support to hippi_cmd for clearing port stats.

From previous version (unlabeled) to 0.1 Beta:

	Code nearly completely rewritten. Functional changes include:
	  -Ports that need to be disabled (PS32 18C boards) must now be
	   so indicated in the config.hippi file with the 'needdisabled'
	   option.
	  -Added ablitiy to dynamically configure most daemon parameters.
	  -Seperate address line in configuration file for address-
	   related stuff.
	  -Different types of default logical address are selectable.
