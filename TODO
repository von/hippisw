		TODO list


 o	Add support to harp for HP, and others.
 o	Add hosts/nets to be gatewayed by a dxe (?)
 o	Combine log and syslog stuff.
 o	Add setting of page size for ES-1.
	- Add general switch-based connection setup
 o	Add tcpwrapper-type connection control.
 o	After disconnection, wait a little before reconnecting to give
	terminal server a chance to clear the port.
 o	Update Makefile to use install.
 o	harp convex output: remove old route before adding new
 o	hippisw: Allow SIGINT to break out always (done?)
 o	Replace log unexpected start string with prompt


		Current bug list

 o	Clearing password send count on connect combined with fact that
	the terminal server disconnects after three bad passwords results
	in maximum password send count never being reached.
	FIX: check for "Password OK" string.
 o	If daemon loses connection to a switch it doesn't realise it until
	a user connects to the switch. This need to be handled more
	gracefully (don't drop user connect).
 o	Ifield '-l' flag not working right.
 o	First connection by user to switch after INIT string is sent
	is dropped?
 o	Last line of input from pipe being dropped?
	The problem is that saving pathways on the PS32 takes so long that
	the hippiswd times out and assumes its gotten a prompt. What
	needs to be done is to disallow timing out for prompts and have
	a comprehensive list of prompts.
