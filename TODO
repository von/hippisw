		Current bug list

 o	Clearing password send count on connect combined with fact that
	the terminal server disconnects after three bad passwords results
	in maximum password send count never being reached.
	FIX: check for "Password OK" string.
 o	If daemon loses connection to a switch it doesn't realise it until
	a user connects to the switch. This need to be handled more
	gracefully (don't drop user connect).
 o	Ifield '-l' flag not working right.
