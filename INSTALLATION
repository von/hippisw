		HIPPISW Installation Instructions

Platforms tested on:
	SUN IPC running SunOS 4.1.2
	SGI Indy running IRIX 5.2
	SUN Sparc 5 running SunOS 5.4

It should compile and work on about any Unix platform. If you run into
any problems or do any ports please let me know.


1) Edit Makefile to fit your needs:

 1a) Set MAGIC_STRING if so desired. MAGIC_STRING defines a string passed from
	client to the daemon. If the daemon doesn't see the expected string
	from the client it will return a bad magic error. This can be used
	for a rudimentary security. You may also leave it as it is.

 1b) Set default location of configuration file if so desired. By default
	HIPPISW programs will look for the configuration file in
	the local specified by CONFIG_FILE. (Note: if desired additional
	locations to check for the configuration file may be added by
	editing read_config.c.)

 1c) Set the installation locations of the binaries and man pages. BIN_DIR
	and MAN_DIR control the installation locations used by 'make install'.

 1d) Normally the hippiswd daemon only requires a password for operations
	that directly effect it (restarting and killing). If you want it
	to require a password for any connection, then uncomment the line
	defining HIPPISWD_REQUIRE_PASSWD.

 1e) If you don't have gcc then change the definition of CC to gcc. You
	will probably also have to uncomment the line defining NO_PROTOTYPES.

 1f) Normally the hippiswd daemon used the LOG_DAEMON facility to log things
	to syslog(). This can be changed by defining SYSLOG_FACILITY.

2) Run 'make'. It will create a architecture specific directory and build
	all the object files and binaries in it.

3) Run 'make install'. This will copy all the binaries and man pages to their
	final destination.

 3a) 'make clean' will remove everything but the binaries from the architecture
	directory. 'make clobber' will completely remove the architecture
	directory.

4) Edit config.hippi to reflect the hippi network at your site. See
	hippi_config(5) for a description of what this file should look
	like. EXAMPLES_CONFIGS/hippi.config is also included as an example.
	This file then needs to be placed in the location specified by
	the CONFIG_FILE variable in the Makefile.

5) Create a working directory for the hippiswd daemon (if needed). This
	is the directory hippiswd writes various files in and looks for
	it's password file. This is the directory specified in config.hippi
	under the 'dir' option on the hippiswd line.

6) Edit config.hippi.password to contain any passwords the hippiswd daemon
	will need to talk to your switches as well as the password the client
	needs to talk to it. See config_hippi_password(5) for a description.
	See EXAMPLES_CONFIGS/config.hippi.password for an example. This file
	then needs to be put in the hippiswd working directory. The
	permissions should be set strict as possible on this file.

7) Run 'hippi_config'. This should come back with a parsed form the the
	config.hippi file. Look for any warnings or errors at the beginning
	of the output. Any errors need to be corrected before any further
	programs can be run.

8) Run 'hippiswd'. It should background itself and connect to all the switches
	described in config.hippi. Check the log file (hippiswd.log in it's
	working directory) to see if it's having any problems.

9) Run 'hippisw'. If you only have one switch in config.hippi you should
	now find yourself connected to that switch. If you have multiple
	switches you will be instructed to specify a switch with 'switch
	<switchname>' (you can also specify the switch as an argument on
	the command line). You can also use the switch command to change
	between switches. Use 'quit' or ^D to exit.

10) Try out the 'mksw' utility. Run 'mksw' and look at it's output (you
	probably want to pipe it into a pager as it's liable to be long).
	You should see a number of commands for your switches that configure
	logical addresses as specified by the config.hippi file. You will
	also see a number of comments (lines preceded by a '#') - these
	will be automatically filtered by hippisw.

	By piping the output into hippisw you will pipe the commands to
	your switches and configure them. WARNING: this will clear the
	current configuration so don't do this until you are certain
	you are happy with mksw's output.

11) Try out the other utilities. They are harp, which generates hippi arp
	tables for various hosts, ifield, which returns logical addresses
	and sources routes, and hippi_cmd, which generates switch commands
	for clearing and displaying statistics. They are described in 
	detail in hippi_utils(8).
